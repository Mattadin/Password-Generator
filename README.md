# Password-Generator

## The Project

This project is designed to create a password generator using logical loops between particular criteria chosen by a user. It functions by creating prompts to collect user's information for the design of their custom password allowing some customizability to meet user needs. Comments left for ease of refactor or re-use for any other future projects of similar builds.

## Usage

Simply click the generate password button, answer a few simple questions and voila! Simple, straight forward, effective. My three favorite things!
